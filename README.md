You can find some main key functions in this repo on how to estimate the moving vehicle and some supporting functionalities. Note that the source codes provided here are not the complete package that makes our NinJa project run, but some of the core functions can be seen to let you grasp how in general the system works. If you familiar with OpenCV, perl, javascript, html5, and JSON, then you can figure out in general how to run it also in your own environment.
